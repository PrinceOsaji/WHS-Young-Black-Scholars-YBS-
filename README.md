Thanks for checking out our site, and we're happy to have you in our club! Make sure to stay tuned for upcoming events and meetings!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Upcoming Meetings (College Talks)

```markdown

1. October 6, 2020: John Hopkins University
2. October 20th, 2020: Pepperdine University and Oxycidental College

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PrinceOsaji/WHS-Young-Black-Scholars-YBS-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
